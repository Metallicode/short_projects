The Taylor series is a mathematical series that is used to approximate functions. It is named after the mathematician Brook Taylor, who first introduced the concept in the early 18th century.

A Taylor series is an infinite series of terms that are calculated using the derivatives of a given function at a certain point. The Taylor series for a function f(x) at a point x=a is given by the following formula:

f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)(x-a)^2/2! + f'''(a)(x-a)^3/3! + ...

In this formula, f(a) is the value of the function at the point x=a, f'(a) is the first derivative of the function at that point, f''(a) is the second derivative, and so on. The terms in the series are calculated by taking the derivatives of the function at the point x=a and evaluating them at x.

The Taylor series can be used to approximate a function near a given point by truncating the series after a certain number of terms. The more terms that are included, the more accurate the approximation will be.

For example, the Taylor series for the function f(x) = sin(x) at the point x=0 is given by the following formula:

sin(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ...

This series can be used to approximate the value of sin(x) near x=0 by truncating the series after a certain number of terms. For example, if we include only the first three terms of the series, we get the following approximation:

sin(x) â‰ˆ x - x^3/6

This approximation is not very accurate for values of x that are far from 0, but it becomes more accurate as x gets closer to 0.

The Taylor series is a powerful tool for approximating functions and has many applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering.
